<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>To interact with chains in the Polkadot ecosystem it is required to know how transactions are encoded and how to read state. For doing this Substrate, the framework used by most of the chains in the Polkadot ecosystem, exposes metadata about the runtime to the outside. UIs, wallets, signers, etc can use this metadata to interact with the chains. This makes the metadata a crucial piece of the transaction encoding as users are relying on the interacting software to encode the transactions in the correct format. It gets even more important when the user signs the transaction on an offline signer as the latter by its nature can not get access to the metadata without relying on the online wallet to provide it the metadata. So, the idea is that the metadata is chunked and these chunks are put into a merkle tree. The root hash of this merkle tree represents the metadata. Cryptographically digested together small number of extra-metadata information, it allows the offline signers and wallets to decode transactions by getting proofs for the individual chunks of the metadata. This digest is also included into the signed data of the transaction (but not sent as part of the transaction). The runtime is then including its known metadata root hash and extra-metadata constants when verifying the transaction. If the digest known by the runtime differs from the one that the offline signer used, it very likely means that the online wallet provided some invalid data and the verification of the transaction fails thus making metadata substitution impossible. The user is depending on the offline wallet showing them the correct decoded transaction before signing and with the merkelized metadata they can be sure that it was the correct transaction or the runtime will reject the transaction.</p>
<p>Thus we propose following:</p>
<p>Add a metadata digest value to signed data to supplement signer party with proof of correct extrinsic interpretation. This would ensure that hardware wallets always use correct metadata to decode the information for the user.</p>
<p>The digest value is generated once before release and is well-known and deterministic. The digest mechanism is designed to be modular and flexible. It also supports partial metadata transfer as needed by the signing party's extrinsic decoding mechanism. This considers signing devices potentially limited communication bandwidth and/or memory capacity.</p>
<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<h3 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h3>
<p>While all blockchain systems support (at least in some sense) offline signing used in air-gapped wallets and lightweight embedded devices, only few allow simultaneously complex upgradeable logic and full message decoding on the cold off-line signer side; Substrate is one of these heartening few, and therefore - we should build on this feature to greatly improve transaction security, and thus in general, network resilience.</p>
<p>As a starting point, it is important to recognise that prudence and due care are naturally required. As we build further reliance on this feature we should be very careful to make sure it works correctly every time so as not to create false sense of security.</p>
<p>In order to enable decoding that is small and optimized for chain storage transactions, a metadata entity is used, which is not at all small in itself (on the order of half-MB for most networks). This is a dynamic data chunk which completely describes chain interfaces and properties that could be made into a portable scale-encoded string for any given network version and passed along into an off-chain device to familiarize it with latest network updates. Of course, compromising this metadata anywhere in the path could result in differences between what user sees and signs, thus it is essential that we protect it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have 2 problems to be solved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Metadata is large, takes long time to be passed into a cold storage device with memory insufficient for its storage; metadata SHOULD be shortened and transmission SHOULD be optimized.</li>
<li>Metadata authenticity SHOULD be ensured.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of now, there is no working solution for (1), as the whole metadata has to be passed to the device. On top of this, the solution for (2) heavily relies on a trusted party managing keys and ensuring metadata is indeed authentic: creating poorly decentralized points of potential failure.</p>
<h3 id="solution-requirements"><a class="header" href="#solution-requirements">Solution requirements</a></h3>
<h4 id="include-metadata-digest-into-signature"><a class="header" href="#include-metadata-digest-into-signature">Include metadata digest into signature</a></h4>
<p>Some cryptographically strong digest of metadata MAY be included into signable blob. There SHALL NOT be storage overhead for this blob, nor computational overhead; thus MUST be a constant within a given runtime, deterministically defined by metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata information that could be used in signable extrinsic decoding MAY be included in digest, its inclusion MUST be indicated in signed extensions;</li>
<li>Digest MUST be deterministic with respect to metadata;</li>
<li>Digest MUST be cryptographically strong against pre-image, both first (finding an input that results in given digest) and second (finding an input that results in same digest as some other input given);</li>
<li>Extra-metadata information necessary for extrinsic decoding and constant within runtime version MUST be included in digest;</li>
<li>It SHOULD be possible to quickly withdraw offline signing mechanism without access to cold signing devices;</li>
<li>Digest format SHOULD be versioned.</li>

<p>Metadata should be stripped from parts that are not necessary to parse a signable extrinsic, then it should be separated into a finite set of self-descriptive chunks. Thus, a subset of chunks necessary for signable extrinsic decoding and rendering could be sent, possibly in small portions (ultimately - one at a time), to cold device together with proof.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single chunk with proof payload size SHOULD fit within few kB;</li>
<li>Chunks handling mechanism SHOULD support chunks being sent in any order without memory utilization overhead;</li>
<li>Unused enum variants MUST be stripped (this has great impact on transmitted metadata size; examples: era enum, enum with all calls for call batching).</li>

<li>UI/wallet implementors</li>
<li>Offline wallet implementors</li>
</ul>
<p>All chain teams are stakeholders, as implementing this feature would require timely effort on their side and would impact compatibility with older tools.</p>
<p>This feature is essential for <strong>all</strong> offline signer tools; many regular signing tools might make use of it. In general, this RFC greatly improves security of any network implementing it, as many governing keys are used with offline signers.</p>
<p>Implementing this RFC would remove requirement to maintain metadata portals manually, as task of metadata verification would be effectively moved to consensus mechanism of the chain.</p>
<p>The idea for this RFC was brought up by runtime implementors and was extensively discussed with offline wallet implementors. It was designed in such a way that it can work easily with the existing offline wallet solutions in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="explanation"><a class="header" href="#explanation">Explanation</a></h2>
<p>The FRAME metadata provides a lot of information about a FRAME-based runtime. It contains information about the pallets, the calls per pallet, the storage entries per pallet, information about runtime APIs and type information about most of the types used in the runtime. For decoding transactions on an offline wallet, we mainly require this type of information. Most of the other information in the FRAME metadata is actually not required for the decoding, and thus, we can remove them. Thus, we have come up with a custom representation of the metadata and how this custom metadata is chunked, ensuring that we only need to send the chunks required for decoding a certain transaction to the offline wallet.</p>
<p>A reference implementation of this process is provided in <a href="https://docs.rs/metadata-shortener/latest/metadata_shortener/">metadata-shortener</a> crate.</p>

<p>Values for:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>u8</code> metadata shortening protocol version (as encoded enum variant), </li>
<li>The <code>Id</code> of type of the outermost Call enum (u32) as described in https://docs.rs/frame-metadata/latest/frame_metadata/v15/struct.ExtrinsicMetadata.html#structfield.call_ty</li>

<li><code>spec_version</code> <code>String</code> (see explanation below) as found in the <code>RuntimeVersion</code> at generation of the metadata. While this information can also be found in the metadata, it is hidden in a big blob of data. To avoid transferring this big blob of data, we directly add these values here,</li>
<li><code>spec_name</code> <code>String</code> as found in the <code>RuntimeVersion</code>,</li>
<li><code>u16</code> ss58 prefix,</li>
<li><code>u8</code> decimals value or <code>0u8</code> if no units are defined,</li>

<p>constitute metadata descriptor. This is minimal information that is, together with (shortened) types registry, sufficient to decode any signable transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Note on <code>spec_version</code></strong>: this type is described in metadata; it is indeed u32 in Polkadot and Kusama and most other networks and thus could be defined in a typesafe manner, but theoretically, it could be anything, as long as it is serializable. We saw a couple of networks using u16 there in the past. Not that it's all that important, but as long as our protocol would be the only limitation - it would be a limitation for our protocol; it would be unwise to enforce it here without first enforcing it upstream.</p>
<p>The version is not exactly an algebraic number - it has comparison operation, but no other algebra is defined; the primitive variable with these properties is really a <code>String</code>, not an integer. We've argued a lot about this internally, but with a naive JS-style solution, we have all the flexibility we might want and no real downsides (as from the point of view of our protocol, it's just an opaque constant - key for database search).</p>

<p>The top node of the tree we call <strong>root</strong>.</p>
<p>All node values for non-leave nodes are not terminal are computed through non-commutative <strong>merge</strong> procedure of child nodes.</p>
<p>In CBMT, all layers must be populated, except for the last one, that must have complete filling from the left.</p>

<h2 id="testing-security-and-privacy"><a class="header" href="#testing-security-and-privacy">Testing, Security, and Privacy</a></h2>
<p>All implementations MUST follow the RFC to generate the metadata hash. This includes which hash function to use and how to construct the metadata types tree. So, all implementations are following the same security criteria. As the chains will calculate the metadata hash at compile time, the build process generally needs to be trusted. However, this is already a solved problem in the Polkadot ecosystem using reproducible builds. So, anyone can rebuild a chain runtime to ensure that a proposal is actually containing the changes as advertised.
Implementation can also be tested easily against each other by taking some metadata and ensuring that they all come to the same metadata hash.
Privacy of users should also not be impacted. This assumes that wallets will generate the metadata hash locally and don't leak any information to third party services about which chunks a user will send to its offline wallet. Besides that there is no leak of private information as getting the raw metadata from the chain is an operation that is done by almost everyone.</p>
<p>To be able to recall shortener protocol in case of vulnerability issues, a version byte is included.</p>

<h3 id="performance"><a class="header" href="#performance">Performance</a></h3>
<p>This is negligibly short pessimization during build time on the chain side. Cold wallets performance would improve mostly as metadata validity mechanism that was taking most of effort in cold wallet support would become trivial.</p>
<p>There should be no measurable impact on performance to Polkadot or any other chain using this feature. The metadata root hash is calculated at compile time and at runtime it is optionally used when checking the signature of a transaction. This means that at runtime no performance heavy operations are done.</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics"><a class="header" href="#ergonomics">Ergonomics</a></h3>
<p>The proposal alters the way a transaction is build, signed and verified. So, this imposes some required changes to any kind of developer that wants to construct transactions for Polkadot or any chain using this feature. As the developer can pass 0 for disabling the verification of the metadata root hash, it can be easily ignored.</p>
<h2 id="prior-art-and-references"><a class="header" href="#prior-art-and-references">Prior Art and References</a></h2>
<p>This project was developed upon a Polkadot Treasury grant; relevant development links are located in <a href="https://github.com/Alzymologist/metadata-offline-project">metadata-offline-project</a> repository.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to exist a similar solution to what the RFC proposes right now. However, there are other solutions to the problem of trusted signing. Cosmos for example has a standardized way of transforming a transaction into some textual representation and this textual representation is included in the signed data. Basically achieving the same as what the RFC proposes, but it requires that for every transaction applied in a block, every node in the network always has to generate this textual representation to ensure the transaction signature is valid. Furthermore, since rendering of this textual representation is potentially non-trivial (with use of non-printed glyphs, direction control, escape characters, etc.), inclusion of arbitrary textual representation increases attack surface and potentially results in subtly false sense of security.</p>

<h2 id="future-directions-and-related-material"><a class="header" href="#future-directions-and-related-material">Future Directions and Related Material</a></h2>
<p>Changes to code of all cold signers to implement this mechanism SHOULD be done when this is enabled; non-cold signers may perform extra metadata check for better security. Ultimately, signing anything without decoding it with verifiable metadata should become discouraged in all situations where a decision-making mechanism is involved (that is, outside of fully automated blind signers like trade bots or staking rewards payout tools).</p>
