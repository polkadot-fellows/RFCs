## Summary

The current election mechanism for permissionless collators on system chains was introduced in
[RFC-7](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0007-system-collator-selection.md).
This RFC proposes a mechanism to facilitate replacements in the invulnerable sets of system chains
by breaking down barriers that exist today.

## Motivation

Following RFC-7 and the [introduction of the collator election
mechanism](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1340), anyone can now collate on a system
chain on the permissionless slots, but the invulnerable set has been a contentious issue among
current collators on system chains as the path towards an invulnerable slot is almost impossible to
pursue. From a technical standpoint, nothing is preventing a permissionless collator, or anyone for
that matter, from submitting a referendum to remove one collator from the invulnerable set and add
themselves in their place. However, as it quickly becomes obvious, such a referendum would be very
difficult to pass under normal circumstances.

The first reason this would be contentious is that there is no significant difference between
collators with good performance. There is no reasonable way to keep track of arbitrary data on-chain
which could clearly and consistently distinguish between one collator or another. Collators that
perform well propose blocks when they are supposed to and that is what is being tracked on-chain.
Any other metrics for performance are arbitrary as far as the runtime logic is concerned and should
be reasoned upon by humans using public discussion and a referendum.

The second reason for this is the inherently social aspect of this action. Even just proposing the
referendum would be perceived as an attack on a specific collator in the set, singling them out,
when in reality the proposer likely just wants to be part of the set and doesn't necessarily care
who is kicked. In order to consolidate their position, the other invulnerables will rally behind the
one that was challenged and the bid to replace one invulnerable will probably fail.

Existing invulnerables have a vested interest in protecting any other invulnerable from such attacks
so that they themselves would be protected if need be. The existing collator set has already
demonstrated that they can work together and subvert the free market mechanism offered by the
runtime when they agreed to not outbid each other on permissionless slots after the new collator
selection mechanism was introduced.

The existing invulnerable set on a given system chain are there for a reason; they have demonstrated
reliability in the past and were rewarded by governance with invulnerable slots and a bounty to
cover their expenses. This means they have a solid reputation and a strong say in governance over
matters related to collation. The optics of a permissionless collator actively challenging an
invulnerable, even when it's justified, combined with the support of other invulnerables, make the
invulnerable set de facto immutable.

While there should be strong guarantees of stability for invulnerables, they should not be a closed
circle. The aim of this RFC is to provide a clear, reasonable, fair, and socially acceptable path
for a permissionless collator with a proven track record to become an invulnerable while preserving
the stability of the invulnerable set of a system parachain.

## Explanation

### Proposal

This RFC proposes a periodic, mandatory, round-robin, two-round election mechanism for
invulnerables.

### How it works

The election should be implemented on top of the current logic in the `collator-selection` pallet.
In this mechanism, candidates would register for the first round of the next election by placing
deposits.

When the period between elections passes, the first round of the election starts with every
candidate that registered, excluding the incumbent, as an option on the ballot. Votes should be
expressed using tokens which should not be available for other transactions while the election is
ongoing in order to introduce some opportunity cost to voting. After a certain amount of time
passes, the election closes and the candidate who wins the first round of the election advances to
the second and final round of the election. The deposits held for voting in the first round must be
released before the second round.

In the second round of the election, the winner of the first round has the chance to replace the
invulnerable currently holding the slot. A referendum is submitted to replace the incumbent with the
winner of the first round of the election, turning the second round of the election into a
`conviction-voting` compatible referendum. If the referendum fails, the incumbent keeps their slot.

The period between elections should be configurable at the `collator-selection` pallet level. A full
election cycle ends when the pallet held an election for every single invulnerable slot. To qualify
for the ballot, candidates must have been collating for at least one period from a permissionless
slot or be the incumbent.

### Motivations behind the particularities of this mechanism

- Round-robin - It is not desirable to allow any election of the entire invulnerable set at once
  because the main purpose of invulnerables is to ensure the stability, reliability and liveness of
  the parachain. It is safer to change them one by one and, in case mistakes happen, governance has
  time to react without endangering the liveness of any chain.
- Two-round voting - it's useful to separate the election process into two distinct steps: the
  first, less important step of determining the challenger at the pallet level through deposits; the
  second, more important step of actually trying to replace the invulnerable by referendum, which is
  the same mechanism the invulnerable used to acquire the slot in the first place. It is not so
  important who is trying to replace the incumbent as long as they meet the requirements and they
  have a clear way to get to the second round of the election. 
- Mandatory - The runtime, not any particular individual, is actively pushing the invulnerables to
  convince people that they not only deserve to keep their invulnerable slots, but that they deserve
  it more than any of the other candidates that registered; the rules of the chain enforce this
  mechanism so no blame or ill-intent can be attributed to other individuals.
- Periodic - In order to provide a reasonable path towards an invulnerable slot, no seat can be
  permanent and should be challenged periodically.
- Ballot qualification - Any invulnerable collator must have a proven track record as a collator, so
  allowing only current permissionless collators to run against the current invulnerable minimizes
  the chance of human error by restricting the number of incompatible choices.

### Corner cases

- If no candidate registers for an election, the slot will become empty, unless the number of
  collators is lower than the minimum number allowed by the pallet configuration, defined in
  `MinEligibleCollators`.
- In case of equality for the first and second positions, the candidate that registered first wins the election.
- In case no collator registers or qualifies for the first round of the election, the incumbent is
  automatically granted the win and gets to keep the invulnerable slot.

## Drawbacks

The first major drawback of this proposal is that it would put more responsibility on governance by
having people vote regularly in order to maintain the invulnerable collator set on each chain. Today
the `collator-selection` pallet employs a fire-and-forget system where the invulnerables are chosen
once by governance vote. Although in theory governance can always intervene to elect new
invulnerables, for the reasons stated in this RFC this is not the case in practice. Moving away from
this system means more action is needed from governance to ensure the stability of the invulnerable
collator sets on each system chain, which automatically increases the probability of errors.
However, governance is the ultimate source of truth on-chain and there is a lot more at stake in the
hands of governance than the invulnerable collator sets on system chains, so I think this risk is
acceptable.

The second drawback of this proposal is the imperfect voting mechanism. Probably the simplest and
most fair voting system for this scenario would have been First Past the Post, where all candidates
participate in a single election round and the candidate with the most votes wins the election
outright. However, the downside of such a system is the technical complexity behind running such an
election on-chain. This election mechanism would require a multiple choice referendum implementation
in the `collator-selection` pallet or at the system level somewhere else (e.g. on the Collectives
chain), which would be a mix between the `conviction-voting` and `staking` pallets and would
possibly communicate with all system chains via XCM. While this voting system could be useful in
other contexts as well, I don't think it's worth conditioning the invulnerable collator redesign on
a separate implementation of the multiple choice voting system when the Two-Round proposed achieves
the objectives of this RFC.

## Testing, Security, and Privacy

All election mechanisms as well as corner cases can be covered with unit tests.

## Performance, Ergonomics, and Compatibility

### Performance

The chain will have to run extrinsics to start and end elections periodically, but the impact in
terms of weight and PoV size is negligible.

### Ergonomics

The invulnerables will be the most affected group, as they will have to now compete in elections
periodically to secure their spots. Permissionless candidates will now have a clear, though not
guaranteed, path towards becoming an invulnerable, at least for a period of time.

### Compatibility

Any changes to the election mechanism of invulnerables should be compatible with the current
invulnerable set interaction with the collator set chosen at the session boundary. The current
invulnerable set for each chain can be grandfathered in when upgrading the `collator-selection`
pallet version.

## Prior Art and References

This RFC builds on RFC-7, which introduced the election mechanism for system chain collators.

## Unresolved Questions

- How long should the period between individual elections be? How long should the full election
  cycle be?
    - There should be a bit more than one month between individual elections, so that if there are 5
      invulnerables on system chains, a full election cycle would take 6 months.
- How long should the voting stay open?
    - It probably should just be a fixed period (e.g. 1 week) or maybe it can be the entire period
      before the next election begins.

## Future Directions and Related Material

The main spinoff of this RFC might be a multiple choice poll implementation in a separate pallet to
hold a First Past the Post election instead of the Two-Round System proposed, which would prompt a
migration to the new voting system within the `collator-selection` pallet. Additionally, a more
complex solution where the voting for all system chains happens in a single place which then sends
XCM responses with election results back to system chains can be implemented in the next iteration
of this RFC.
