## Summary

The Fellowship Manifesto states that members should receive a monthly allowance on par with gross
income in OECD countries. This RFC proposes concrete amounts.

## Motivation

In order for members to uphold their commitment to the network, they should receive support to
ensure that their needs are met such that they have the time to dedicate to their work on Polkadot.
Given the high expectations of Fellows, it is reasonable to consider contributions and requirements
on par with a full-time job. Providing a livable wage to those making such contributions makes it
pragmatically possible to work full-time on Polkadot.

## Stakeholders

- Fellowship members
- Polkadot Treasury

## Explanation

Although the Manifesto (Section 8) specifies a monthly allowance in DOT, this RFC proposes the use
of USDT instead. The allowance is meant to provide members stability in meeting their day-to-day
needs. Using USDT provides more stability and less speculation.

Based on USDT, this RFC proposes the following _yearly_ salary levels, based on rank:

1. 10,000
2. 20,000
3. 80,000
4. 120,000
5. 160,000
6. 200,000

Note that there is a sizable increase between II Dan (Proficient) and III Dan (Fellow). By the third
Dan, it is generally expected that one is working on Polkadot as their primary focus in a full time
capacity. The salary at this level is commensurate with average salaries in OECD countries (note:
77,000 USD in the U.S., engineering average 100,000 USD).

The salary increases for Architects (IV, V, and VI Dan) with levels typical of senior engineers.

Levels 7 and above will be determined when a member is promoted to those ranks.

Allowances will be managed by the Salary pallet.

## Drawbacks

By not using DOT for payment, the protocol relies on the stability of other assets and the ability
to acquire them. However, the asset of choice can be changed in the future.
