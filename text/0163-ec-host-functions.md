## Summary

This RFC proposes a set of host functions for performing computationally intensive elliptic curve
operations in Polkadot runtimes. These host functions enable efficient execution of cryptographic
primitives that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive when executed in a virtual environment.

The proposal covers five elliptic curves:
