## Summary

This RFC proposes a change to the current deposit requirements on the Polkadot Asset Hub for creating NFT collections. The objective is to lower the barrier to entry for artists, fostering a more inclusive and vibrant ecosystem, while maintaining network integrity and preventing spam.

## Motivation

The current deposit of 10 DOT for collection creation on the Polkadot Asset Hub presents a significant financial barrier for many artists, especially with the potential volatility in DOTâ€™s price. By lowering the deposit requirements, we aim to encourage more artists to participate in the Polkadot NFT ecosystem, thereby enriching the diversity and vibrancy of the community and its offerings.

## Stakeholders

- **Artists**: Primary beneficiaries of the proposed change, particularly those who found the current deposit requirements prohibitive.
- **KodaDot**: As the facilitator of artists' relations, KodaDot has a vested interest in making the platform more accessible.
- **Polkadot Community**: Stands to benefit from an influx of artists and diverse NFT collections, enhancing the overall ecosystem.
- **Parity**: The developers of Polkadot, who may need to implement and oversee the changes.

Previous discussions have been held within the KodaDot community, as well as with artists expressing their concerns about the deposit amounts.
